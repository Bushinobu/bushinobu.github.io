   <div class="article-content">
     <p>As any San Franciscan can tell you--and a fact visitors will soon learn--there are numerous neighborhoods in this city. Each of them is unique in their own way, but few feel as distinguished (or out of place) as the Outer Sunset does.</p>
     <p>Affectionately called the "Surfer Ghetto" by some locals, the Outer Sunset is a primarily residential community that embraces beach culture, an easy going lifestyle, and general wellbeing. In the early part of the 20th century, the Outer sunset was largely a desert wasteland bordered by the pacific Ocean. However, during the 1920s, this began to change and residential homes were being constructed en masse and, by the middle of the century the bulk of the construction was complete. But don't let these homey and residential origins fool you--the Outer Sunset is the most populous neighborhood in San Francisco with over 85,000 people living here and with nearly endless things to do, it's easy to see why.</p>
     <p>Fiercely resistant to chains and commercial stores, the Outer Sunset is peppered with eclectic boutiques, relaxing cafes, quiet bars, savory restaurants, and historic sites. The main strips are on Judah, Lawton, Noriega, and Taraval streets, with other hidden gems peppered throughout the neighborhood. So come breathe in the sea air, dig your feet into the sand, and let Surfer Ghetto guide you through these sunkissed streets.</p>
